How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The bug was easily spotted in seconds without going through the entire code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps see how the system has grown and is easy to revert to an older version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You may forget to commit for a long time
    Cons: You have control over the commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs is not for code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log shows the changes and diff shows the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to when it worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   Work on my project
